# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

After cloning the repository and navigating to the project folder using the cd command, here are the necessary terminal commands that need to be run. 

1) Run `bundle install`
2) Run `bundle update`
3) Run `rails db:migrate` (if there was an error do steps 5 and 6)
4) If there is a yarn error run `yarn install --check-files`
5) run `rails db:migrate`
6) run `rails server`
7) go to localhost:3000 on Firefox(if successful should see a simple login page)
